For printing, use the
[top12spikes.stl](https://github.com/headrotor/freecad-sputniki/blob/main/top12spikes.stl)
file and print two of them. I used .15 mm slicing with supports
(needed for the dingbats). Each half has two alignment holes on either side of a hanging hole
drilled all the way through. By cutting small bits of 1.75mm printer
filament and inserting them in the alignment holes you can make sure
both halves line up perfectly. You can glue the two halves together or
just rely on gravity.

There is a small space in the center for a knot, or the central hole
goes all the way through. You can then hang them by inserting a string
or monofilament through the central hole, or they stand nicely on
their bottom tripod as a desk or table ornament.


Share & enjoy!
