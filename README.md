Procedurally generated holiday decorations for 3D printing


More information at [http://www.rotormind.com/blog/2020/FreeCAD](http://www.rotormind.com/blog/2020/FreeCAD)

For printing, use the
[top12spikes.stl](https://github.com/headrotor/freecad-sputniki/blob/main/top12spikes.stl)
file and print two of them. I used .15 mm slicing with supports
(needed for the dingbats).

Share & enjoy!
